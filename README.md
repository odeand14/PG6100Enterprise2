# PG6100Enterprise2
Project task Enterprise2, this is our project for the Enterprise 2 exam.
Our task was to build a microservice game using Kotlin and Spring, along with various assets. We decided to make a tic-tac-toe game.
Our goal was to create it with a react GUI, however we spent more time than expected on other functionality, so as it stands we do not have a GUI.
Instead we have focused on creating extensive end-to-end tests to simulate the different functionalities working together, and how the game works.

## Getting started
